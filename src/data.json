      "content": "Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only place in the universe known to harbor life. Approximately 70.8% of Earth's surface is made up of the ocean while the remaining 29.2% is land, consisting of continents and islands. Earth's surface layer is formed of several slowly moving tectonic plates, which interact to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes.",

    "structure": {
      "content": "Earth's interior, like that of the other terrestrial planets, is divided into 7 layers by their chemical or physical (rheological) properties. The radius of the inner core is about one-fifth of that of Earth.Among the Solar System's planetary-sized objects Earth is the object with the highest density.",

      "content": "Earth's surface is the top layer of Earth's rigid or liquid structure, at the interface with its atmosphere. Earth as an idealized spheroid has a surface area of about 510 million km2 (197 million sq mi).[15] Earth can be devided into two hemispheres. Generally, Earth is divided by latitude into the polar Northern and Southern hemispheres, or by longitude into the continental Eastern and Western hemispheres. Regarding the surface distribution of land and water, Earth can be divided into an oceans-focused water hemisphere and a landmasses-focused land hemisphere.",
